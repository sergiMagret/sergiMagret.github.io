Web in progress, I'm updating the web as I refresh my memory on HTML and learn new things in the [freeCodeCamp courses](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn):
- Responsive Web Design Certification
- JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures Certification
- Front End Libraries Certification

Check my freeCodeCamp profile if you want to see the progress [here](https://www.freecodecamp.org/fccd1b93dbf-075b-493e-9c20-88ae0556818a).
